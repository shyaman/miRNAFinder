.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAup
calculates the thermodynamics of RNA-RNA interactions. RNA-RNA
binding is decomposed into two stages. (1) First the partition function for
secondary structures of the target RNA subject to the constraint that a
certain sequence interval (the binding site) remains unpaired is
computed. (2) Then the binding energy given that the binding site is
unpaired in the target is calculated as the optimum over all possible types
of bindings.   
.br
In the current version the longer RNA molecule is considered to be the
target sequence, the shorter one is assumed to be a small regulatory
RNA. The small RNA is assumed to be unstructured. RNA sequences are read
from stdin as strings of characters, white space and newline within a
sequence cause an error. Newline is used to separate sequences. To
compute the hybrid structure of two molecules, they have to be
concatenated using the '&' character as separator. The input file may
contain more than one sequence'&'sequence pair.  
.br
RNAup computes the probability that a region within the target is
unpaired, the conditional probability of an interaction between two
molecules, given that an interaction is possible, and the optimal free
energy of binding at a given position along the target sequence.
.br
Output consists of the mfe of the target sequence, a string indicating the
pairing preference of the target and the free energy of the thermodynamic
ensemble of the target in kcal/mol. The string indicating the pairing
preference consists of the letters '. , | { } ( )' denoting bases that are
essentially unpaired, weakly paired, strongly paired without preference,
weakly upstream (downstream) paired, or strongly up- (down-)stream paired
bases, respectively.
.br
The output of RNAup depends on three options: \-o, \-u and \-x. To generate
an output file the \-o switch has to be specified. If only one sequence is
given the output is the probability of being unpaired independent of the
choice of \-o.
If two sequences concatenated using the '&' character are given option \-o1
outputs only the probability of being unpaired and option \-o2 writes out
the probability of being unpaired, the conditional probability of an
interaction and the optimal free energy of binding. The -u option
determines the length of the unpaired region in the output. The -x option
specifies the different contributions of the probability of being unpaired
in the output. 
.br 
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting
of the single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-w \fIlength\fP
This option determines the maximal length of the unstructured region used
for the calculation of the probability of being unpaired. The default
value is 25.   
.TP
.B \-5(\-3) \fIlength\fP
These option are only used for the calculation of the interaction
probability and the optimal free energy of binding. They extend the region
determined by -w by length residues to the 5' and /or the 3' side,
respectively. The underlying assumption is that it is favorable for an
interaction if not only the direct region of contact is unpaired but also a
few residues 5'and 3' of this region. 
.TP 
.B \-o[1|2]
This option specifies the output. The -o option has to be given if you want
the program to make an output! Please consider options \-u and \-x for
modulating the output. Default is -o1 if only one sequence is given and -o2
if two sequences, concatenated via '&', are given. If the sequence is
preceded by a line of the form 
> name
The output file is called name_"values of \-w and \-u"_up.out, where name
consists of the first 30 characters of the name. If no sequence name is
given, the default output file is RNA_"values of \-w and -u"_up.out. -o1
creates a file containing only the probability of being unpaired. The total
probability of being unpaired as well as its different
contributions might be plotted (see option \-x ). -o2 additional provides
the conditional probability of an interaction and the optimal free energy
of binding at a given position.
.B \-u \fIlength\fP
This option modulates the output. It determines the length of the
unstructured region given in the output. The default value is 4. This means
that by default the probability that 4 consecutive residues are
unstructured is given. An unstructured region [i,j] includes residue [i]
and residue [j], the probability that region [i,j] is unstructured is
plotted at position [j], that is at the right boarder of the region. 
.TP
.B \-x \fISEHIM\fP
This option modulates the output. It determines which contributions to the
probability of being unpaired are given. The probability of being unpaired
is the sum ("S") of the probability of being unpaired in the exterior loop
("E"), within a hairpin loop ("H"), within an interior loop ("I") and within a
multiloop ("M"). Any combination of these five letters may be given.
.PP
the \-p, \-p0, \-noGU, \-noCloseGU, \-nsp, \-S, \-e, \-P, \-noLP, \-T, \-4,
\-d and \-C options work as in \fBRNAfold\fP, see there for description.
