.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAplfold
computes local pair probabilities for base pairs with a maximal span
of L. The probabilities are averaged over all windows of size L that
contain the base pair. For a sequence of length n and a window size of L the
algorithm uses only O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is
practical to "scan" very large genomes for short stable RNA structures.

Output consists of a dot plot in postscript file, where the averaged pair probabilities
can easily be parsed and visually inspected.

In conjunction with the -u option, it is also possible to compute the probability
that a stretch of x consequtive nucleotides is unpaired, which is useful
for predicting possible binding sites. Again this probability is averaged
over all windows containing the region. The output is a plain text list
containing on each line a position i followed by the probability that the
region [i-x+1..i] is unpaired.  

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-W winsize
Average pair probabilities over windows of size \fIwinsize\fP. Default 70.
.PP
.TP
.B \-L span
Allow only pairs (i,j) with j\-i<=span. Default winSize.
.PP 
.TP
.B \-c cutoff
Report only base pairs with an average probability > \fIcutoff\fP in the
dot plot; default=0.01.
.PP
.TP
.B \-u width
Compute the mean probability that regions of length \fIwidth\fP is unpaired.
.PP 
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-d\fP \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP,
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options work as in
RNAfold.
