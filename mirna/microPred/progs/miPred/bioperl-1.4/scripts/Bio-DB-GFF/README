These are utilities that go with the Bio::DB::GFF module.

examples/Bio-DB-GFF/load_gff.PLS:

Slow but foolproof GFF table to database loader.

examples/Bio-DB-GFF/bulk_load_gff.PLS:      

Fast loader, but wipes database clean each time.

examples/Bio-DB-GFF/fast_load_gff.PLS:

EXPERIMENTAL incremental loader that is as fast as bulk loader, but only works on Unix platforms.

scripts/Bio-DB-GFF/generate_histogram.PLS: 

Generate histogram of sequence features, for use with generic genome browser.

scripts/Bio-DB-GFF/process_gadfly.PLS:     

Tweak GadFly GFF files for loading (drosophila).

scripts/Bio-DB-GFF/process_wormbase.PLS:   

Tweak WormBase GFF files for loading (elegans).

scripts/Bio-DB-GFF/process_sgd.PLS:        

Turn SGD feature dumps into GFF files for loading (saccharomyces).

scripts/Bio-DB-GFF/process_ncbi_human.PLS: 

Turn NCBI feature dumps into GFF files for loading (human).
