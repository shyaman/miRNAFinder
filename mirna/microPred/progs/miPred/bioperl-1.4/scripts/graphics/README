These are scripts that run on top of Bio::Graphics.

examples/graphics/render_sequence.pl:

fetch a GenBank or EMBL entry off the net (fetching by accession
number) and render into a graphical picture

scripts/graphics/feature_draw.PLS:

render a set of features into a drawing, using
Bio::Graphics::FeatureFile's idiosyncratic (but relatively friendly)
feature notation.

scripts/graphics/frend.PLS:		

the same thing, but a CGI front end
