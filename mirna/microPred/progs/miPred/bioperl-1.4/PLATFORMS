Perl general comments:

	o Perl must be 5.005 or higher. We tend to test on
          5.6 Perl. Perl 5.8 definitely works, but might have
          small errors

	o Perl on Digital Unix, WindowsNT, and MacOS has been reported
          to have problems with the Bio::DB::GDB on module (and
          consequently the test GDB.t). This is due to different
          versions of HTML::Parser.

	o DB.t has intermittent time-out failures (which will most
	  likely cause tests 3 and/or 27 to fail).

	o Index.t will fail if you have an out-of-date DBM file
	  installation or a bad DB_File installation


Tested systems & OS Specific Comments or Warnings
==================================================

Machine : RedHat Linux 7.2 i686
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004-5.6.1
Comments: XML::Writer tests fails (segfault), but do an install/force anyways
	  and all will work.

Machine : Linux i386
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004-5.6.1
Comments: none

Machine : Digital Unix
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004
Comments: Failure on GDB.t, possibly due to LWP cissues

Machine : OpenBSD 2.8 i386
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.6.0
Comments: none

Machine : Solaris 2.8 UltraSparc
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.0
Comments: none

Machine : FreeBSD 4.2 i386
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.005_03
Comments: none

Machine : IRIX64 6.5 SGI
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004_04
Comments: Some warnings about <HANDLE> which can be safely
	  ignored. Bio::DB::GenBank/GenPept cannot be used because
	  IO::String cannot be installed on 5.004.  Bio::DB::GDB will
	  not work on pre 5.005 versions of perl.

          The makefile's should now work without shell modifications.
          Let us know if that's an issue

Machine : Win32, WinNT i386
Compiler: --
Perl    : ActiveState Perl 5.6, 5.5.1
Comments: Be sure that the module DB_File is installed and up-to-date 
	  to allow Bio::Index modules to work properly. 
	  Installing ppm's IO-stringy and IO-String and File-Temp are 
	  necessary as well.
  
          See INSTALL.WIN for more information
	
Machine : CygWin NT_5 v. 1.3.10,18 on Windows 2000 5.00
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.1,5.8
Comments: Recommend that blastall app be obtained from NCBI
          (blast/executables/blastz.exe). expat is part of Cygwin.
          Cygwin has an error in the SearchIO test, possibly due to some
          temporary file issues
        
Machine : MacOS
Compiler: --
Perl    : MacPerl
Comments: Issues and possible ways to fix them summarized by Todd Richmond
          on the bioperl.org Wiki. We don't recommend using Bioperl on
          MacOS 9 systems

Machine : MacOS X
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.0
Comments: Steve Cannon has made available Bioperl OS X installation
	  directions and notes online at the following URL:
	  http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cann0010/Bioperl_OSX_install.html

Machine : HP-UX / PA-RISC 11.0
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.1
Comments: Tested by (dag@sonsorol.org) on a barebones 8-cpu system without the
          various dependencies installed. All tests pass except those
          skipped by the test harness due to missing external packages. Thanks
          due to HP for providing the OBF with an Itanium workstation plus
          internet access to other HP test platforms. Feedback from HP-UX users
          is appreciated.

Machine : HP-UX / Itanium ('ia64') 11.0
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.1
Comments: Tested by (dag@sonsorol.org) on a barebones 4-cpu system without the
          various dependencies installed. 96% of the tests pass; OBF is 
          working on getting 100% pass rate. Thanks due to HP for providing 
          the OBF with an Itanium workstation plus internet access to other 
          HP test platforms. Feedback from HP-UX users is appreciated.
