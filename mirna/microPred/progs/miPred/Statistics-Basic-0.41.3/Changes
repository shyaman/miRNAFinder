0.41.3:  Thu Mar 25 12:48:56 EST 2004
   - jettero took out the stoopid mod::sig, everyone hated
     it anyway

0.41.1 and 0.41.2: Tue Mar 23 07:59:46 EST 2004
   - Copyright clarifications.  ... GPL with a twist.

0.41:  Fri Jan 30 08:54:37 EST 2004
   - jettero found an amazingly STUPID typo in the Basic.pm
     Statisics anyone?

0.4:  Thu Jan 29 11:20:51 EST 2004
   - jettero added the UNBIAS flag for those that wish to
     use (N-1) in their variance. Perhaps I should switch
     the default. We will see.

0.39:  Fri Dec 12 07:18:18 EST 2003
   - jettero changed the NAME field to match CPAN

     the new new()s

0.37:  Mon Dec  8 20:58:08 EST 2003
   - jettero cleaned up the new() functions so they don't
     require arguments for no reason

0.36:  Sat Dec  6 11:32:17 EST 2003
   - jettero added (linear) LeastSquareFit

0.35:  Tue Dec  2 17:04:58 EST 2003
   - jettero was working on the documentation in Basic.pm
     when he realized the need for ginsert and set_vector
     around the world... finished implementing those.

0.34:  Tue Dec  2 14:45:11 EST 2003
   - jettero tought the ::CoVariance module to take ::Mean
     objects as optional arguments to keep the ::Correlation
     object from uselessly recalculating the mean as
     mentioned in the entry below in 0.33.

0.33:  Tue Dec  2 14:00:48 EST 2003
   - jettero did an amazing amount of work on the objected
     oriented structrues, the tests in t/ and added the
     queuing functions to the packages. He also added the
     Vector object to handle some things. Note that the
     author is aware that the Mean get's uselessly
     recalculated for some the high level objects...
     Solution forthcomming...
