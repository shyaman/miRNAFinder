microPred Version 1.0
------------------------
microPred program can be used to classify human pre-miRNAs from pseudo hairpins and other ncRNAs.

Authors: Rukshan Batuwita and Vasile Palade, Computing Laboratory, University of Oxford.

System requirements:
---------------------
- The current version of microPred predictor has been developed for linux platform (Redhat/Fedora).
- Perl and java VM should be pre-installed.


How to excute the microPred:
-----------------------------
1. Copy the input file containing the sequences to be classified into the 'microPred/data' directory.
   The input file should contain the sequences in fasta format. Please do not keep empty lines in between the sequences 
   or after the last sequence of the input file. Otherwise, this will cause problems when running the RNAfold program (Hofacker, 2003) 
   used in the microPred package. (For an correctly formatted input fasta file see microPred/data/seq.fasta). 
 
2. Execute the perl scipts 'microPred.pl' which is in the 'microPred/progs' directory as follows:
   microPred/progs> perl microPred.pl [input_file]
   Ex: microPred/progs>perl microPred.pl seq.fasta 

   microPred.pl calls the corresponding scripts for the following tasks:
    - to extract all the features.
    - to isolate the best 21 features.
    - to format the features into SVM input format.
    - to scale the feature values.
    - to predict the sequences either as pre-miRNAs or not by using the best SVM model developed in our research.
      As the SVM predictor the LIBSVM(Chang and Lin, 2001) package is used.


Important:
---------------------------
- To calculate zG,zD,zQ,zP and zF features, 1000 random sequence are generated for each original sequence following the method 
  described in (Loong and Mishra, 2007). Therefore, in order to generate these random sequences, fold them, and calculate 
  these z-features it might take a long time depending on the number of original sequences in the input file. 
  Estimated time for this operation for 10 sequences is about 30mins. Therefore, we recommend to use an input file containing 
  a fewer number of sequences (maximum of 100 sequences) in a single run.


Results:
-----------
- All the features extracted from the sequences will be written to 'microPred/data/all.input_file.-48.features'.
- The selected best 21 features will be written to 'microPred/data/selected.input_file.-21.features'.
  These features are in the order[%(C+G),MFEI1,MFEI2,dG,dQ,dF,zD,NEFE,Diff,dS,dS/L,Avg_BP_Stems,(A-U)/L,(G-C)/L,(G-U)L,
                                   %(A-U)/stems,%(G-C)/stems,%(G-U)/stems,MFEI3,MFEI4,Diversity]. 
- The results of the predictions will be written to 'microPred/SVM/input_file.predictions'.
  [Here +1 represent that the corresponding sequence has been predicted as a pre-miRNA candidate.
       -1 represent that the corresponding sequence has been predicted as a negative candidate.]

Additional Details about the different scripts used to assemble the microPred program:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 'microPred/progs' directory contains all the scripts used to calculate the features and to format them.
    - 'microPred/progs/miPred' directory contains the scripts for calculating miPred (Loong and Mishra, 2007)features. These scripts were written for 
      (Loong and Mishra, 2007)and available at http://web.bii.a-star.edu.sg/~stanley/Publications/Supp_materials/06-002-supp.html
    - 'microPred/progs/mfe14.java' and 'microPred/progs/mfe23.java' scripts for calculating the MFE-related features(written by us).
    - 'microPred/progs/bpcount1.java' and 'microPred/progs/bpcount2.java' scripts for calculating the base pairs-related features(written by us).
    - 'microPred/progs/RNAfold/RNAfold' for calculating RNAfold-related features(Hofacker, 2003).
    - 'microPred/progs/RNAfoldfilter.java' for filtering RNAfold-related features(written by us).
    - 'microPred/progs/melt.pl' for calculating the mfold-related features and taken from UNAfold package (Markham and Zuker, 2008).
    - 'microPred/progs/Mfoldfilter.java' for filtering mfold-related features (written by us).
    - 'microPred/progs/filter_all.java' for filtering all the extracted fetures (written by us). 
    - 'microPred/progs/format1' for formatting features for SVM prediction (written by us).
    
- 'microPred/SVM' directory contains the scripts related to the SVM predictor.
    - 'microPred/SVM/svm-scale' for scaling the feature values into [-1,+1] (Chang and Lin, 2001).
    - 'microPred/SVM/svm-predict' for predicting sequences as pre-miRNAs or not (Chang and Lin, 2001).  

- 'microPred/progs/microPred.pl' script glues all these programs together as the main program	.
